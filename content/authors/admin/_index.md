<!-- I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.njit.edu/) at [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu/) under the supervision of [Lou Kondic](https://web.njit.edu/~kondic/) and [Linda J. Cummings](https://people.njit.edu/faculty/lcumming#about). In general, my research focuses on the self-and-directed assembly mechanism of thin liquid films (typically of nanoscale thickness) using a combination of mathematical theory and simulations. One of my primary focuses is the inclusion of thermal effects in thin liquid films exposed to laser irradiation. Due to the multiscale nature of these types of problems, asymptotic analysis is often implored to reduce difficult partial differential equations to easier ones that describe the physics to great accuracy. I perform two types of simulations: (i) finite-difference method simulations on moving domains, and (ii) molecular dynamics simulations of liquid metal alloys. The latter is performed in collaboration with scientists from Oak Ridge National Laboratory ([ORNL](https://www.ornl.gov/)) and University of Tennessee (UTK) using the supercomputers [TITAN](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/olcf-resources/compute-systems/titan/) and [SUMMIT](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/summit/) (the fastest supercomputer in the world). -->

<!-- Outside of research, I enjoy daily jogging and cycling and, in general, love everything outdoors. I am obsessed with coffee and am a novice coffee roaster.  -->

Ryan Allaire is assistant professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the United States Military Academy, West Point. He currently serves as a department academic counselor, course director for MA365, and a department co-advisor for the Math Forum. 

He pursued his higher education as a true New Jersey native, earning an A.S. in mathematics from Mercer County Community College in 2010 and a B.A. in mathematics from Rutgers University, New Brunswick, in 2012. He began his graduate education at Montclair State University, where he studied fluid dynamics, eventually earning his M.S. in pure and applied mathematics in 2015. 

To complete his studies, he pursued his doctoral education at New Jersey Institute of Technology and made significant advances in the mathematical modeling of thin films with high-performance computing and asymptotic analysis. Dr. Allaire received his Ph.D. in applied mathematics from New Jersey Institute of Technology in 2021. 

Outside of work, Dr. Allaire enjoys outdoor activities, such as cycling and running, and is a novice coffee roaster.
