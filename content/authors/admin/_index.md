I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.njit.edu/) at [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu/) under the supervision of [Lou Kondic](https://web.njit.edu/~kondic/) and [Linda J. Cummings](https://people.njit.edu/faculty/lcumming#about). In general, my research focuses on the self-and-directed assembly mechanism of thin liquid films (typically of nanoscale thickness) using a combination of mathematical theory and simulations. One of my primary focuses is the inclusion of thermal effects in thin liquid films exposed to laser irradiation. Due to the multiscale nature of these types of problems, asymptotic analysis is often implored to reduce difficult partial differential equations to easier ones that describe the physics to great accuracy. I perform two types of simulations: (i) finite-difference method simulations on moving domains, and (ii) molecular dynamics simulations of liquid metal alloys. The latter is performed in collaboration with scientists from Oak Ridge National Laboratory ([ORNL](https://www.ornl.gov/)) and University of Tennessee (UTK) using the supercomputers [TITAN](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/olcf-resources/compute-systems/titan/) and [SUMMIT](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/summit/) (the fastest supercomputer in the world).

Outside of research, I enjoy daily jogging and cycling and, in general, love everything outdoors. I am obsessed with coffee and am a novice coffee roaster.
