publication: "On the Three Dimensional Interaction between Flexible Fibers and Fluid Flow"
publication_short: ""

abstract: In this paper we discuss the deformation of a flexible fiber clamped to a spherical body and immersed in a flow of fluid moving with a speed ranging between 0 and 50 cm/s by means of three dimensional numerical simulation developed in COMSOL. The effects of flow speed and initial configuration angle of the fiber relative to the flow are analyzed. A rigorous analysis of the numerical procedure is performed and our code is benchmarked against well established cases. The flow velocity and pressure are used to compute drag forces upon the fiber. Of particular interest is the behavior of these forces as a function of the flow speed and fiber orientation. The Vogel exponents, which characterize the rate of bending of a fiber in a flow, are found for the various configurations examined here and seem to display interesting variations. These exponents are then compared with our previously studied two-dimensional models.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This work utilizes COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate the deformation of a flexible fiber attached to a sphere and immersed in a fluid flow. The drag force is then computed around the fiber and a scaling law (Vogel exponents) are then calculated and matched against existing literature.
