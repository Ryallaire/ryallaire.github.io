publication: "The role of phase separation on Rayleigh-Plateau type instabilities in alloys. Submitted to the Journal of Physical Chemistry C."
publication_short: ""

abstract: Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to investigate the role of phase separation (PS) on the Rayleigh-Plateau (RP) instability. Ni-Ag bulk structures are created at temperatures 2000K and 1400K which generate different PS lengthscales, $\lambda_{\rm PS}$, relative to the RP instability lengthscale, $\lambda_{\rm RP}$. Rectanguloids are then cut from the bulk structures and patterned with a perturbation of certain amplitude and wavelength, $\lambda_{\rm RP}$. It is found that when $\lambda_{\rm PS} \ll \lambda_{\rm RP}$ (2000K) the patterned rectanguloids break up into nanoparticles in a manner consistent with classical RP theory, whereas when $\lambda_{\rm PS} \approx \lambda_{\rm RP}$ (1400K), soluto-capillarity affects the RP instability significantly. Specifically, since Ag has a lower surface energy than Ni, Ag migrates to cover neighboring Ni regions, therefore modifying the RP instability. Thus, we demonstrate that the phase separation lengthscale of an immiscible alloy can be exploited to direct the assembly of functional bi-metallic alloys.
