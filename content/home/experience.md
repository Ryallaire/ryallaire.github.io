  Highlights:
  * Developed mathematical model describing leading order thermal effects in the evolution of nanoscale thin films.
  * Developed and implemented numerical algorithm(s) for comparing various models of heat conduction in the presence of a free surface, including a time-dependent mapping that can be applied to various physical problems on moving domains.
  * Implemented a fully implcit 3D heat conduction/thin film solver into the GPU architecture, [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone), under the C++ framework.
  * Simulated large scale molecular dynamics simulations of liquid metal alloys using LAMMPS software with the supercomputers (TITAN & SUMMIT at Oak Ridge National Laboratory).
  * Simulated large scale GPU simulations of heat conduction using local nvidia gpu, STHENO cluster at NJIT, and SUMMIT supercomputer at ORNL.
